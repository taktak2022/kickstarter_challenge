# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
An Analysis to assist Louise with the optimal strategy for a Theater Kickstarter Campaign
---
##Outcomes Based on Creation Date
---
* Theater Plays were more successful in their campaigns than Musicals.
* The Creation Date had no direct bearing on the number of backers for a given Theater campaign.
* Both successful and failed campaigns increased in years 2011, 2012 and 2013.
* Both successful and failed campaigns at least doubled in years 2014 and 2015 where it reached its peak during the period between 2009-2017.  
* All of the increases in both successes and failures started in an upward trajectory during the second quarter of the years between 2011-2015.  Although many factors may have contributed to this, it is my assumption that the following may include, but are not limited to having led to the increases in contributions in Q2: 1) Christmas/Holiday debts get paid off.  2) Fiscal year-end bonuses allowing for donation funding.  3) Tax returns also allow for additional funds that can lead to contributions.  In certain cases contributions may even allow for a tax credit.

##Outcomes Based on Goals
---
* There was no direct correlation between the Goals and Actual Pledged amounts.
* The length of the campaign was not tied to the eventual outcome in some cases
* Goals were much higher compared to actual contributions.  This pattern was shared as compared to other entertainment venues (i.e. the Film industry).  Although the actual contribution amounts were much lower in the Theater sector as compared to the Film sector.
* The percentage failed actually surpassed successes for Goal amounts between $15000.00 and $34999.00; and then again over amounts of $44999.00.

##Limitations of Dataset
---
* The data does not explain why there was such an increase in contribution successes and failures in years 2014 and 2015.  What was the catalyst that led to the increase of the contributions?  Did Theater cecome popular in those years?  If so, why?  More research and/or date is needed.

###Personal limitations of this assignment
* The information to complete this assignment seems disorganized and confusing.  I was having to re-read over and over different sections of the module.  Even the instructor and TA admitted to it being "confusing".  
* Also there is not enough information about using GitHub on the module itself.  As you can see from above, the recommended code to add a PNG image from module 1.6.1 did not work so i copied the actual link to it.
* I did utilize the AskBCS Learning Assistant on several occasions.  The first time I was immediately told "I only have 20 minutes" as he rushed through adding a TEST folder in GitHub.  Needless to say, I did not learn much from that interaction.  The second time was no better as he suggested I reach out to Microsoft for assistance.  Honestly I learned more from watching YouTube videos than the Learning Assistants.  I attended one OFFICE HOURS session which was dominated by students who needed assistance just like me so much so that I did not have any time to get any.
